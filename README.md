## Hello
Iâ€™m currently really interested in:

- [Phaser](http://phaser.io/)
    - I have [a starter template that leverages Visual Studio Code, TypeScript, and Node.js](https://github.com/JamesSkemp/phaser-3-vsc-typescript-nodejs)
- TypeScript
- Advanced Git
    - [My personal Git commands site](https://git.jamesrskemp.com/), for keeping track off all those less frequently used commands, and hopefully helping others.

You can also find me on [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/strivinglife).
